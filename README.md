# Snake-with-Q-learning
A future web tool for playing around with Q-learning using the game snake.

## Game plan, not in order:
- Implement model framework
  - Handle the dynamic parameters, update model as it goes
  - Build with visualization in mind
- Game logic somehow
- Create UI
  - Snake game rendering
  - Dynamic parameter adjustment
  - Data visualization underneath
- Make some sort of backend to handle events between frontend UI and backend model framework.
   - Handles data processing
   - Handles input from frontend of course
   - Probably flask, because the model is in python

## Order, more or less
For each feature I add:
Frontend
Backend

profit

 ## Notes
 Make no mistakes 🔥
